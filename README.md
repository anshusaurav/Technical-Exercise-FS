### Most importantly remember to replace AWS S3's bucket_name, AWSAccessKeyId and AWSSecretKey wth your own. I have kept those keys of mine in the .env file in the project root, and which ofcourse have been put in the gitignore file so not be make them public.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
